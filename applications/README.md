# Made in Purebasic (open-source)
- animatoon : a 2D bitmap painting application.
- cartoon :  a 2D vector drawing and animating software.
- SpriteAnim : an animation software which use sprite/image for animation (there is a little tool, inside, to create vector drawing (lite version of Cartoon)).

You can use it, modify it, but please provide the new sources and don't forget my name Blendman ;).

All those projets are open-source (GPLv3).


Thanks.
